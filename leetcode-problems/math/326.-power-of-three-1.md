# 326. Power of Three

* Link: [https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/)

## Problem

> If n = power of 3, return True, else False, `2^-31 <= n <= 2^31-1`

## Follow Up

> Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

## My Solution

1. 就... recursion

Hence it should be possible to divide `n` by b `x` times, every time with a remainder of `0` and the end result to be `1`.

## Result

Runtime: 72 ms, faster than 76.87% of Python3 online submissions for Power of Three.

Memory Usage: 14.1 MB, less than 75.86% of Python3 online submissions for Power of Three.

## Improvements

$$
n = 3^i \rightarrow i = log_3n\rightarrow i = \frac{log_bn}{log_b3}
$$

1. 數學解: `n` is a power of 3 if and only if `i` is an integer

   ```python
    if (math.log(n) / math.log(3)) % 1 == 0: # is integer?
        return True
    else:
        return False
   ```
